"Cash collections are
calculated by adjusting sales for the changes in accounts receivable and unearned
(deferred) revenue.
Cash used in the production of goods and services (cash inputs) is calculated by
adjusting cost of goods sold (COGS) for the changes in inventory and accounts
payable.
Indirect Method
Using the indirect method, operating cash flow is calculated in four steps:
Step 1:
 Begin with net income.
Step 2:
 Add or subtract changes to related balance sheet operating accounts as follows:
Increases in the operating asset accounts (uses of cash) are subtracted,
while decreases (sources of cash) are added.
Increases in the operating liability accounts (sources of cash) are added,
while decreases (uses of cash) are subtracted.Step 3:
 Add back all noncash charges to income (such as depreciation and amortization)
and subtract all noncash components of revenue.
Step 4:
 Subtract gains or add losses that resulted from financing or investing cash flows
(such as gains from sale of land).
Most firms present the cash flow statement using the indirect method."
"Note that interest paid is technically a
cash flow to the creditors, but it is already included in CFO under U.S."
"Some of the more common differences include inventory
methods (FIFO and LIFO), depreciation methods (accelerated and straight-line),
and lease accounting (capital and operating).

"GAAP.
Depreciation
The historical cost of capitalized physical assets is allocated over their economic
(useful) lives by recording depreciation expense."
"Also, if the firm presents its cash flow
statement using the indirect method, the gain or loss is removed from net income to
compute cash flow from operations because the proceeds from selling a long-lived asset
are an investing cash inflow.
If a long-lived asset is abandoned, the treatment is similar to a sale, except there are no
proceeds."
"GAAP, loss recoveries are not permitted.

"These details can help an analyst understand the
implications of the events that give rise to changes in deferred tax items and better
predict future tax rates by considering the factors that caused a difference between the
statutory and effective rates.
Some differences in reporting result from the fact that under IFRS upward asset
revaluations give rise to DTAs, DTLs and DTAs are netted for reporting
 purposes, and,
rather than reporting a valuation allowance, DTAs are adjusted directly for any
probability that they will not be realized (reversed).

issuance costs, which increases the bond’s effective interest cost."
"Since the sum of interest expense and depreciation is greater than the lease
payment in the early years of a finance lease, reporting a lease as a finance lease will
decrease net income and profitability ratios compared to reporting the lease as an

A smaller salvage value will have the opposite effects.
"Analysts should take notice if a firm capitalizes costs that

"The firm should have the ability to prepay short-term borrowings
when cash flow permits and have the flexibility to structure its short-term financing so

"Longer
investment horizons (20 years rather than 2 years), greater assets versus liabilities (morewealth), more insurance against unexpected occurrences, and a secure job all suggest a
greater ability to bear investment risk.
An investor’s 
willingness to bear risk
 is based primarily on the investor’s attitudes and
beliefs about investments (various asset types).
If the investor’s willingness to take on investment risk is high but the investor’s ability
to take on risk is low, the low ability to take on investment risk will prevail in the
advisor’s assessment.
In situations where ability is high but willingness is low, the advisor may attempt to
educate the investor about investment risk and correct any misconceptions.

value minus liabilities and preferred stock."
"Because these
parameters are highly uncertain, the analyst should compare the estimated value from
the Gordon growth model with value estimates from other models.
Using Price Multiples to Value Equity
Because the dividend discount model is very sensitive to its inputs, many investors rely
on other methods."
"Analysts often consider asset-based model values as floor or
minimum values when significant intangibles, such as business reputation, are involved.
Asset-based model valuations are most reliable when the firm has primarily tangible
short-term assets, assets with ready market values (e.g., financial or natural resource
firms), or when the firm will cease to operate and is being liquidated.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Valuation Models
Advantages of discounted cash flow models:
They are based on the fundamental concept of discounted present value and are
well grounded in finance theory.
They are widely accepted in the analyst community.
Disadvantages of discounted cash flow models:
Their inputs must be estimated.
Value estimates are very sensitive to input values.
Advantages of comparable valuation using price multiples:
Evidence that some price multiples are useful for predicting stock returns.
Price multiples are widely used by analysts.
Price multiples are readily available.
They can be used in time series and cross-sectional comparisons.
EV/EBITDA multiples are useful when comparing firm values independent of
capital structure or when earnings are negative and the P/E ratio cannot be used.
Disadvantages of comparable valuation using price multiples:
Lagging price multiples reflect the past.
Price multiples may not be comparable across firms if the firms have different
size, products, and growth.
Price multiples for cyclical firms may be greatly affected by economic conditions
at a given point in time.
A stock may appear overvalued by the comparable method but undervalued by a
fundamental method, or vice versa.
Different accounting methods can result in price multiples that are not comparable
across firms, especially internationally.
A negative denominator in a price multiple results in a meaningless ratio."
"An 
inverse floater
 has a coupon rate that increases when the reference
rate decreases and decreases when the reference rate increases.

Embedded options may benefit the bond issuer, increasing the required market yield, or
benefit the bondholder, decreasing the required market yield."

"Both a sovereign’s ability to collect taxes and its
ability to print the local currency lead to higher ratings on bonds issued in the local
currency compared to sovereign debt issued in the currency of a developed economy
(e.g., USD or euros)."
"The difference
between a serial bond issue and an issue with a sinking fund is that with a serial bond
issue, investors know the dates when specific bonds will be redeemed.
In general, corporate bonds are referred to as short-term if they are issued with
maturities of up to 5 years, medium-term when issued with maturities from 5 to 12
years, and long-term when maturities exceed 12 years.
Corporations issue debt securities called medium-term notes (MTNs), which are not
necessarily medium-term in maturity."
