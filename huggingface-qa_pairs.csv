    ""Analysts often consider asset-based model values as floor or
minimum values when significant intangibles, such as business reputation, are involved.
Asset-based model valuations are most reliable when the firm has primarily tangible
short-term assets, assets with ready market values (e.g., financial or natural resource
firms), or when the firm will cease to operate and is being liquidated.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Valuation Models
Advantages of discounted cash flow models:
They are based on the fundamental concept of discounted present value and are
well grounded in finance theory.
They are widely accepted in the analyst community.
Disadvantages of discounted cash flow models:
Their inputs must be estimated.
Value estimates are very sensitive to input values.
Advantages of comparable valuation using price multiples:
Evidence that some price multiples are useful for predicting stock returns.
Price multiples are widely used by analysts.
Price multiples are readily available.
They can be used in time series and cross-sectional comparisons.
EV/EBITDA multiples are useful when comparing firm values independent of
capital structure or when earnings are negative and the P/E ratio cannot be used.
Disadvantages of comparable valuation using price multiples:
Lagging price multiples reflect the past.
Price multiples may not be comparable across firms if the firms have different
size, products, and growth.
Price multiples for cyclical firms may be greatly affected by economic conditions
at a given point in time.
A stock may appear overvalued by the comparable method but undervalued by a
fundamental method, or vice versa.
Different accounting methods can result in price multiples that are not comparable
across firms, especially internationally.
